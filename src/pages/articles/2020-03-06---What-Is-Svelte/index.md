##What is svelte
  Svelte is a JS framework that borrows ideas from other frameworks, but with a twist of its own. Cause it's not a framework but a compiler of sorts that compiles your code to pure JS without any dependencies added by the framework. That results in very tiny bundle sizes, with all the luxuries of a framework. Sounds tempting ? Read on.

##How is this different from Angular Vue or React
  When I first heard about Svelte, I knew this was different. Cause all those who talked about it seemed to be interested and the vibe surrounding the framework seemed to be promising. It wasn't a me too product. Svelte introduced something that no body else have seen before. It was a framework that will do the work that other frameworks will do but with a much lesser bundle size and very high performance. The creator of Svelte has numerous benchmarks in his twitter page that proves this. Also some real world examples about developers being able to build apps for low power devices like POS machines using React, Vue and many other frameworks.

##Why would you want to use them
  You are building an application were you need very low bundle size, best in class performance and it probably need to run on very low end devices or device which may have poor network capabilities. If these are your key priorities then Svelte is worth trying out.

##What is road forward for Svelte
  Svelte is developed by Rich Harris who works at New York times and is mostly a one man show. But there's a huge open source community backing right now. Svelte isn't a new framework, in fact the first version was released back in 2016 and it grew in popularity in the last few months after the release of version 3. Svelte 3 had brought in many much needed addition to the framework. Svelte also has a static site generator called Sapper which is similar to Gatsby.There's also Svelte Native which will be similar to React Native and Svelte GL which is an alternative for Three.js with Svelte.

If that didn't get you excited I guess you need to hear it right from the horses mouth. Here's a talk Rich Harris gave called Rethinking Reactivity. That will get you fired up.
