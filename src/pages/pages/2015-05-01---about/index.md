Hi, I'm Abhinav Dinesh, a frontend developer and UX designer. Currently I work as a frontend engineer at [FullContact](https://fullcontact.com). While I was doing bachelors degree in Computer Science, I had my own startup called HungryMeNot. After graduation I worked as a *Product Solution Engineer* at [CareStack](https://carestack.com) and after that led the frontend efforts at [Qrech Global Solutions](http://qrech-global.com), a small and young product startup based in the middle east before being part of FullContact.

I code in **JavaScript**, **Angular** and **React** mostly and recently JAM stack have caught my interest, so currently I'm learning **GatsbyJs** and **GraphQL**. This site is powered by Gatsby.

When I'm not coding, I'm either listening to some all time classics or home grown indie music on my beloved RHA earphones. I also travel, although not as much I want to. Reading is a newly acquired habbit thanks to my kindle and my interest in self help books. Productivity tools like Notion, Dynalist and Daylio are my pills for better time management and habit tracking.

I undertake freelance projects which I find challenging and/or fun. I answer on stackoverflow and ocassionaly work on side projects which you can find on my github page. Drop me a mail at <abhinavdinesh@live.com> if you wish to collaborate, discuss your ideas, hire me for a freelance project or just chat.
