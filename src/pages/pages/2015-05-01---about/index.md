Hi, I'm Abhinav Dinesh, a frontend developer and UX designer. I work as a frontend architect at **Qrech Global Solutions**, a small and young product startup based in the middle east. While I was doing bachelors degree in Computer Science, I had my own startup called HungryMeNot. After graduation I worked as a *Product Solution Engineer* at **CareStack**.

I code in **JavaScript**, **Angular** and **React** mostly and recently JAM stack have caught my interest, so currently I'm learning **GatsbyJs** and **GraphQL**. This site is powered by Gatsby.

When I'm not coding, I'm either listening to some all time classics or home grown indie music on my beloved RHA earphones. I also travel, although not as much I want to. Reading is a newly acquired habbit thanks to my kindle and my interest in self help books. Productivity tools like Notion and Daylio are my pills for better time mangement and habit tracking.

I undertake freelance projects which I find challenging and/or fun. I answer on stackoverflow and ocassionaly work on side projects which you can find on my github page. Drop me a mail at <abhinavdinesh@live.com> if you wish to collaborate, discuss your ideas, hire me for a freelance project or just chat.
