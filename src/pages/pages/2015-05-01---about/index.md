Hi, I'm Abhinav Dinesh, a frontend developer and UX designer. I work as a frontend architect at **Qrech Global Solutions**, a small and young product startup based in the middle east. While I was doing bachelors degree in Computer Science, I had my own startup called HungryMeNot. After graduation I worked as a *Product Solution Engineer* at **CareStack**.

**JavaScript**, **Angular**, **React** are my potions of choice for conjuring up any deadly beast. **GatsbyJs** and **GraphQL** are currently brewing in my basement lab to cook up a *super fast, secure and fancier* beast.

When I'm not coding, I'm either listening to some all time classics or home grown indie music on my beloved RHA earphones. I also travel, although not as much I want to. Reading is a newly acquired habbit thanks to my kindle and my interest in self help books. Productivity tools like Notion and Daylio are my pills for better time mangement and habit tracking.

I undertake freelance projects which I find challenging and/or fun. I answer on stackoverflow and ocassionaly work on side projects which you can find on my github page. Drop me a mail at <abhinavdinesh@live.com> if you wish to collaborate, discuss your ideas, hire me for a freelance project or just chat.
